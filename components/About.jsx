        <p>Hi! I’m Ajay Vangara, a student developer at the University of Florida. I've built a variety of projects including full-stack web apps, mobile apps, and cloud-based systems, experimenting with AI and infrastructure along the way. 
            I love creating technology that can have a strong impact on society, both with the use of novel AI and without!</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my skills and projects below, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!</p>
